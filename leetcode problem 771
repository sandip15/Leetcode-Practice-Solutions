//leetcode problem number 771(easy)
/* questioN is ï¼š You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. 
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive (small vs big letters), 
so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". */
